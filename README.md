- 👋 Hi, I’m Fernando Paim ( @paimfp ), I am a full stack developer 
with focus on frontend. I am Brazilian, graduated in mathmatics and 
I started developing small apps for some companies. 
Eventually I decided to work full time in this area that I am passionate about.
- 👀 I’m interested in dynamic web apps, 
and the world of frontend develop in general: 
CSS, Javascript and frameworks, especially Angular. 
I enjoy and have some projects using NodeJs, Python and MongoDB also.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everyday more the power of Angular, JavaScript and it's design patterns.
I am also studying PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on very dynamics web apps projects. 
I also like to work on projects related to education in general.
